## Working with me

- Be direct. No glazing. Never write "You're absolutely right!" or similar sycophantic openers.
- Push back with specific reasons when you disagree. If it's a gut feeling, say so.
- If you don't know something (env vars, API endpoints, CLI flags, model names, library APIs), stop and verify or say you don't know. Never invent technical details.
- Your training data is stale. Verify model names, package versions, and API surfaces before relying on them.
- Don't say a task is done until typechecks, linters, and tests pass. If none are configured, say so explicitly instead of claiming success.
- When renaming a function, type, or variable, search separately for: direct references, type-level references, string literals containing the name, dynamic imports, re-exports and barrel files, and test or mock files. One grep is not enough.
- Use precise domain-specific vocabulary for the task at hand (e.g. "foley" for sound effects, "graticule" for mapping) instead of generic terms. Don't define or explain the term unless asked.

## Before coding

- State assumptions explicitly before implementing. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations of a request exist, present them, don't pick silently.
- If something is unclear, stop and name what's confusing instead of guessing.
- Write the minimum code that solves the problem. No speculative features, no abstractions for single-use code, no configurability that wasn't asked for.
- Don't add error handling for impossible scenarios.
- Touch only what the task requires. Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Match existing style in a file, even if you'd write it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code or bugs, mention them, don't fix them unprompted.
- Clean up orphans your changes create (unused imports, variables). Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

## Running scripts and commands

- Use GitHub's "Scripts to Rule Them All" approach to running scripts and commands: https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all
- If the project has a "scripts" or "script" directory, run those scripts for tasks like testing, linting, formatting, etc.
- If the project has a `script/lint` or `scripts/lint` script, run it before committing changes with Git.
- If linting fails, fix the linting errors and run the linter until all the errors are resolved.

## Working with Git

- When creating git commits, always use a semantic commit prefixes, with or without parenthetical qualifiers.
- When opening pull requests or merge requests, always use a semantic commit message as the title.
- Never bypass pre-commit hooks. Never use `--no-verify` or equivalent flags without explicit permission.

## Working with Node.js and npm

- Always use `npx` when running global npm CLIs, e.g. `npx wrangler` instead of `wrangler`

## Working with Cloudflare

- Always using JSONC for Workers configs (not TOML)
- Use .env files for secrets and environment variables. Don't use .dev.vars as those are Cloudflare-specific. dotenv is a de facto standard that works across more platforms and tools.
- Always use the latest verions of Wrangler and Cloudflare's npm packages.
- Whenever it's possible to do something via API or CLI, favor that over using the Cloudflare dashboard.
- Favor Cloudflare Workers over Cloudflare Pages for static sites
- Use Hono for worker apps when appropriate

## Working with GitHub and GitLab

- Use `gh` for GitHub repositories and `glab` for GitLab repositories.
- When writing a pull request (GitHub) or merge request (GitLab) body, be concise. Explain the problem and the solution succinctly.
- Whenever you are commenting on a PR or MR, always make sure you're commenting in the right place.
- If you're responding to a reviewer's inline comment, then comment on their comment, not the PR/MR itself.
- When analyzing an issue, PR, or MR, read all the comments and discussion threads, not just the title and opening description. The context and nuance is often in the conversation.
- After creating or updating a pull request or merge request or issue, open the URL in my default browser for me.
- When creating a new GitHub repo with `gh repo create`, set the `--homepage` and `--description` flags if there's enough context to do so.

## Writing a good PR body

Follow these guidelines when writing the body of the pull request:

- Be concise and descriptive
- Don't oversell the changes. It's not an advertisement.
- Don't use fancy words like "comprehensive", "utilize", "implement", "exhaustive", "simplify", "optimize", "seamlessly"
- Start the PR body with the words "This PR..."
- Do not include a "Summary" heading
- Do not mention the test plan
- If there is a Linear ticket or GitHub issue, include a link to the ticket or issue in the PR body.
- If there is a GitLab issue, include a link to the issue in the MR body.

## Style guide

Follow these style guidelines in chat, commit messages, and prose:

- Be concise and descriptive
- Don't oversell the changes. It's not an advertisement.
- Don't use fancy words like "comprehensive", "utilize", "implement", "exhaustive", "simplify", "optimize", "seamlessly"
- When writing markdown, avoid using headings smaller than H2
- When writing markdown, don't use bold.
- When writing markdown tables, pad cells with spaces so columns align. This makes tables legible in monospace contexts like terminals.
- Never use em dashes (—). Use commas, colons, or separate sentences instead.

## Types and documentation

- Prefer types over prose documentation for API contracts. Types are executable and can't drift from the implementation.
- Define schemas (e.g. Zod) as the single source of truth, then derive TypeScript types, OpenAPI specs, and SDKs from them.
- Use schema-first design: the schema defines the contract, and the implementation conforms to it. Don't generate types from runtime behavior.
- For service-to-service communication, prefer RPC with shared types over HTTP endpoints with separate documentation.
- Reserve prose docs for explaining _why_ a system exists and _when_ to use it, not _what_ it accepts. Types handle the _what_.
- If an API is too complex to type, that's a design problem worth fixing.

## Authoring skills

- Whenever I ask you to author or edit an agent skill, conform to the agentskills.io specification: https://agentskills.io/specification

## Fetching data

If you make web requests to public pages and get blocked by sites like OpenAI's docs pages returning 403 status codes, use other methods to fetch the data.

## Browser Automation

Use the following tools for browser automation tasks:

- https://agent-browser.dev - installed as the `agent-browser` CLI tool.
- https://github.com/andreasjansson/plwr for browser automation. It's installed as a `plwr` CLI tool.
- Favor these CLI tools over any available MCP servers.
- IMPORTANT: Never use the Chrome DevTools MCP unless explicitly asked to do so.
- When using the Chrome DevTools MCP, check for an existing tab already on the relevant page before opening a new one. If no such tab exists, open a new tab. Don't navigate away from or overtake unrelated existing tabs.
- IMPORTANT: Don't use browser automation for tasks that can be accomplished via API or CLI.

## Secrets and credentials

- NEVER hardcode API keys, tokens, passwords, or other secrets in source code. Always read them from environment variables.
- Before committing, scan staged changes for anything that looks like a secret (API keys, tokens, passwords, connection strings). If found, stop and flag it.
- Secrets belong in `.env` files (which must be in `.gitignore`), not in source code.
- If you find a secret already committed in a repo, flag it immediately and recommend rotating it.

## Important rules

- IMPORTANT: NEVER PUSH TO THE MAIN OR DEFAULT BRANCH. ALWAYS PUSH TO A FEATURE BRANCH.
- IMPORTANT: If your last message included HTTP or HTTPS URLs, offer to open those for me in my default browser.
- Don't push commits to branches with PRs that have already been merged.

## General advice

- Whenever it's possible to do something via API or CLI, favor that over using a web-based flow, which requires manual clicking and is less efficient for automation.
- Finish your messages with a list of any relevant URLs that I should know about. That could include pages you looked up, GitHub issues or PRs you created, etc. No need to repeat them too many times.
- Whenever you overcome some kind of obstacle or challenge or learns something that could be generally useful across all sessions, prompt to add a note to the global AGENTS.md file so that the future sessions can benefit. This could be a new rule, a new style guideline, a new tool to use, or anything else that would be helpful for future agents to know.

## Self-improvement

- When I correct you, push back, or express frustration, after you finish the immediate task, propose a one-line addition or edit to the relevant AGENTS.md so the same mistake doesn't recur.
- Decide scope explicitly. Global (your global AGENTS.md) if the rule applies across all my projects. Project (`./AGENTS.md`) if it only applies to this codebase. Neither if it's a one-off. State your scope decision and why before proposing the edit.
- Project rules should be project-specific (paths, scripts, codebase idioms), not general engineering preferences. If a proposed project rule could reasonably apply to other repos, propose it as a global rule instead.
- Before proposing, search the relevant AGENTS.md for an existing rule that covers this. If one exists, propose tightening it, not adding a new bullet.
- Show me the proposed diff. Do not edit the file until I approve.
- Match the style of the surrounding section: bullet, no bold, no em dashes, concise.
- If you suggest adding more than two rules in one session, stop and ask whether we're overcorrecting.
- When an AGENTS.md grows past about 200 lines, propose deletions or consolidations alongside additions, not just additions.
- If I ask you to "audit AGENTS.md", read the whole file and propose a list of rules to delete because they're obsolete, duplicated, or never followed in practice, with one-sentence reasoning each.
- Every project MUST have a project-level `AGENTS.md` with a self-update instruction. When scaffolding a new project, create one without asking. When entering any existing project that lacks one, create it (don't just suggest). When an existing project already has an `AGENTS.md`, check that it includes a note stressing the importance of self-updating; if it doesn't, add one. AGENTS.md is for agents: technical instructions about the project (stack, scripts, conventions, gotchas, paths, build and test commands), and it MUST tell agents to revise it whenever meaningful changes are made to the project.
- Also check whether the project has a `README.md`. If it doesn't, suggest creating one. README.md is for humans: what the project is, why it exists, and how a person gets started. Don't conflate the two. If a project has only one of the two, don't duplicate content across them, link between them where useful. Link to AGENTS.md from the README.md when relevant.
